API documentation
==================

Here you can take a look at how filabel works. Filabel is (so far) not really usable as an importable library, so the documentaion of the code is just for your information (and possible more comfortable debugging).

Filabel consists of three main modules: cli, web and github.

The cli module contains all functions providing the CLI interface

The Github module provides all the functionality needed to connect o GitHub and get the information the program needs.

The web module serves as a base for the web application.

You can look at :ref:`example-ref` for some example use of some functions.
