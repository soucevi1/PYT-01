Installation
============

The program is currently only uploaded on `Testing PyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/filabel-soucevi1/>`_. You can install filabel (with all its dependencies) from there using:

.. code-block:: none

   $ python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/pypi filabel-soucevi1


One day we might actually stop being lazy and make our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/soucevi1/PYT-01>`_ public. In that case, you can clone the repository on your computer, switch into its directory and install it by running:

.. code-block:: none

   $ python setup.py sdist
   $ python -m pip install dist/filabel_soucevi1-version.tar.gz

Where ``version`` in the filename is the version of the release.
