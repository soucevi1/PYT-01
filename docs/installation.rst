Installation
============

The program is currently only uploaded on `Testing PyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/filabel-soucevi1/>`_. You can install filabel (with all its dependencies) from there using:

.. code-block:: none

   $ python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/pypi filabel-soucevi1


You can also get the program straight from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/soucevi1/PYT-01>`_. In that case, you can clone the repository on your computer, switch into its directory and install it by running:

.. code-block:: none

   $ python setup.py install

You can also create `sdist` or `bdist`

.. code-block:: none

   $ python setup.py sdist
   $ python setup.py bdist_wheel
